# Axon Bodycam System for FiveM

## Key Features:

- **Realistic Bodycam Activation:**  
  The bodycam can be toggled on or off with a simple key command or through in-game events. When activated, the camera begins recording, offering a true-to-life experience.

- **Battery System:**  
  The bodycam runs on battery power, draining as it records. A notification will alert you when the battery is low, and the camera will stop recording once it is depleted. The battery recharges automatically over time or can be fully recharged with a command.

- **Dynamic Sound Effects:**  
  Realistic sounds play when turning the bodycam on or off, and when the camera starts recording, adding immersion as the sound radius mimics real-life operations.

- **Taser Integration:**  
  The bodycam automatically begins recording when a taser is drawn or fired, providing crucial documentation for taser-related incidents.

- **Weapon and Vehicle Integration:**  
  The bodycam utilizes Axon Signal features and starts recording when a sidearm is unholstered or when emergency lights are activated on the playerâ€™s vehicle, keeping track of high-priority situations.

- **HUD Display:**  
  The timestamp is displayed on-screen during recording, simulating the real-time display found on bodycam footage for authenticity.

- **Customizable Commands and Keybinds:**  
  Players can toggle the bodycam and recording functions via in-game commands (`/axonbc` and `/togglerec`) or configure a key mapping for quick access.
